# Automation repetitive task software
Tremendously automated repetitive task sofware  with the motive of contributing to what makes your day to day activities much easier and accessible for you at your work place.
Before jumping to what we've today.I want to use this Opportunity to Thank each and every one of you for contributing in one way or the other and congratulation to  us as well because we recently hit our first 1.2K+ views on GITHUB with over 250 clones on my last repo. However,I'll encourage each and every one of us to keep up the good work. on that note, I want to advance us alittle bit on how to build a good automation task that can be used in your different organization. Please take note of each and every step to fully understand how to repetitive automate a software to perform a particular task without the intervention of human being. it can be considered as a machince learning task.also the following steps will help and assit you to state your algorithm when a atomating a particular task below.

How to understand and use this software:

1. TO begin with, an in-depth knowledge of Javascript and html is needed before jumping on this project. on that note I want to let y'all know that this project was built fresh on my own with the little experience i've been able to accumulate on the programming so far.and taht will take us to the first step of this project.
2. First thing first,make sure you've a good html template well linked to your javascript file because you're building this project with full Javascript action 100%. you only need Html template to output your work.
3. the second step or the second point of view about this project is that, It's automated with only two functions in Javascript namely spread operator using(...params) and "reduce" Array method. let see how it was implimented and used on this software on the next step.
4. Futhermore,The Spread operator can be defined as operator which allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 value is expected. It give us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array. I think we should know the meaning of spread operator because it might sound new to some of us.
5. on the next, I explained the first function as seen on my automation.js. on one hand, I created the a variable which will hold the container of daily transaction of a customer or vendor to an organization. which is customerDailyTransaction and I assign some values to it which represent the deposit from the customer or vendor repeatedly.
6. this step explains more about how the function was implemented on this project. however, on the first function which was the SUM FUNCTION and I assigned(...params) to all the values stored in customerDailyTransaction.
7. note to remember after stating your sum function,make sure you create a constant veriable "element"and assign it to be 0. in reference to the definition of spread opertor in step 4 to understand why I did that.
8. we're almost there and I think this should be the most interesting part of the project. in addition to that, you'll create a "for loop" function that will iterate through the spread opertor and preform any condition been passed on the function.
9. on the sum function,I added the whole items from the variable customerDailyTransaction by saying element += params[I]. what do I mean by that? well,I simply used an assignment operator to add and assign it's value of the element to the params.
 PLEASE NOTE: you can use any word you want in replace of params  but make sure you put them at the right place to be able to execute it's functionalities when called.this function will be able to add up unlimited numbers without breaking out the code.also, give you 100% correct feedback. why is that? because a "FOR LOOP" fucntion has been created for you and it keep ilerating and outputting requried results as programmed anytime it's been called. if you experience any challange when outputting your results then make sure you check your codes and try again or you can reach out to me anytime.
10. the last part can be alittle bit Tricky but I urge you give me your 100% attention for awhile. however, the reduce array method function was used to subtract the total value of the deposit made by a customer. by initiating a reduce method which will execute by saying(totalnum - intial) and the type function created can be called anonymous function in JavaScript. which means the function don't have any idea of the value that will come in, jsut like its name "anonymous".so it's focused on performing the subtracting of the customers balance whenever a withdrawal is been made on the stated bank account.
11. Lastly  on this part,It'll output a greeting message to update the status of your current account activity. 

In summary, making references to how this software can be beneficial and Improve an organizational daily activities can be clearly seen in a CyberSecurity working sector. for example, an entry-level cybersecurity analyst working in a bank sector can be asked by the manager to develop an automation tasks which will take care of the day to day transactions of the bank activities.this is where the tremendous ideas and knowledge can be used or come to live. moreover,you can automate a tasks with Python or Javascript depending on what you want to build and how fast you want your output. well,If you're working with Javascript action then say less.you're at the right place and you're highly welcome on board.seat tight because I still got alot to share with y'all and learn together as well. also,deploying this function on your software functionalities when developing your automation task will safe you enough time and energy as an any entry-level cybersecurity professtional to enable you to focus more on other tasks and be 100% active when a threat actors or hackers tried lunching a denied of service attack on the orginaztion you protect or event with great urgency on the orgnization security.
In addition to that, from my own Perceptive as an aspiring entry-level cybersecurity position, I think this should be a better way and motion to look into and reconsider when handling the security protocols of  large-scale corporation or small scale corporation and organization in cybersecurity. I'm so happy sharing such a tremendous work with Y'all. see you guys soon!
